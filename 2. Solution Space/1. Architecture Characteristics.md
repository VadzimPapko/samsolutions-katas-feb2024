# Architecture Characteristics

After analysis of `MonitorMe` [requirements](../1.ProblemWalkthrough/2.Requirements.md) and key business drivers, we have identified the primary architectural characteristics that the system should incorporate. These key characteristics include Performance, Fault Tolerance and Elasticity.

![Architecture Characteristics](../images/architecture-characteristics.png "Architecture Characteristics")

1. **Performance:** The amount of time it takes for the system to process a business request.

> Based on the requirements, `MonitorMe`reads the data different patient-monitoring equipment vital sign input sources and then sends the data to a consolidated monitoring screen (per nurses station) with an average response time of 1 second or less.

2. **Fault Tolerance:** When fatal errors occur, other parts of the system continue to function.

> Based on the requirements, if any of vital sign device (or software) fails, `MonitorMe` must still function for other vital sign monitoring
> (monitor, record, analyze, and alert).

3. **Scalability:** A function of system capacity and growth over time; as the number of users or requests increase in the system, responsiveness, performance, and error rates remain constant.

> Based on the requirements, StayHealthy, Inc. is looking towards adding more vital sign monitoring devices for `MonitorMe` in the future.

4. **Data Integrity:** The data across the system is correct and there is no data loss in the system.

> Based on the requirements, Vital sign data analyzed and recorded through MonitorMe must be as accurate as possible.

5. **Extensibility:** The ease in which a system can be extended with additional features and functionality.

> Based on the requirements, StayHealthy, Inc. is looking towards adding more vital sign monitoring devices for `MonitorMe` in the future.

6. **Deployability:** The amount of ceremony involved with releasing the software, the frequency in which releases occur, and the overall risk of deployment.

> Based on the requirements, StayHealthy, Inc. expects a lot of change as they learn more about healthcare monitoring market.

> Each physical hospital location will have its own installation of the complete MonitorMe system

7. **Security:** Being an implicit characteristic, it is a crucial part of any software system design.

> Based on the requirements, while patient monitoring data must be secure
