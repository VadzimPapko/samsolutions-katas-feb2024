# Vital signs

Each patient monitoring device transmits vital sign readings at a different rate.

## Readings Rate

| Vital sign | Reading rate  |
| --- | --- | 
| Heart rate | every 500ms |
| Blood pressure | every hour |
| Oxygen level | every 5 seconds |
| Blood sugar | every 2 minutes |
| Respiration | every second |
| ECG | every second |
| Body temperature | every 5 minutes |
| Sleep status | every 2 minutes |

## Considerations

• StayHealthy, Inc. is looking towards adding more vital sign monitoring devices for MonitorMe in the future.

• Vital sign data analyzed and recorded through MonitorMe must be as accurate as possible. After all, human lives are at stake.
